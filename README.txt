Provide instructions on how to compile and run your code, especially if you used a nonstandard Makefile, or you are one of those hackers who insists on doing things differently.

Indicate if you met all problem set requirements (more importantly, let us know where your bugs are and what you did to try to eliminate the bugs; we want to give you as much partial credit as we can).

We have met all problem set requirements. 

Provide some overview of the code design. Don't go into details; just give us the big picture.

We did the initial setup (created a purple cube), completed linFact and transFact, did view change, and completed the object manipulation in the motion function. We wrote a helper function doMtoOwrtA taking into account the auxiliary frame. 

Let us know how to run the program; what are the hot keys, mouse button usage, and so on? Describe steps or sequences of steps the TF should take to test and evaluate your code (especially if your implmenentation strays from the assignment specification).

Press ‘v’ key to change the view mode between The sky camera frame, The frame of cube 1, and The frame of cube 2. 
Press Left button of the mouse: moving the mouse right/left rotates around the y-direction.
Press Left button of the mouse: moving the mouse up/down rotates around the x-direction.
Press Right button: moving the mouse right/left translates in the x-direction.
Press Right button: moving the mouse up/down translates in the y-direction.
Press Middle button (or both left and right buttons down): moving the mouse up/down translates in the z-direction. For apple mouse, you need to press ”Option/Alt” (or space) key + left button.

Finally, did you implement anything above and beyond the problem set? If so, document it in order for the TFs to test it and evaluate it.

NA
